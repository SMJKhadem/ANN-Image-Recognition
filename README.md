# ANN-Image-Recognition
I build an Artificial Neural Network that recognizes objects that you hold into the webcam.
Steps read:
create a virtual environment for your project
collect an image dataset with your webcam
build a neural network from scratch
train a neural network using a pre-built image dataset of handwritten digits
read in and process the images to be used in a machine learning model
use a pre-trained neural network to make predictions of images from your webcam
fine-tune a pre-trained network
